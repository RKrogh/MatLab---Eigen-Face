Part of my Master thesis project.
Purpose is to create Eigen space from standardized image data by vectorizing RGB space and train a model on a given training set using principal component analysis.
The result would be a model on which I then could project any image (not being part of the training data) onto this space and make a representation of it from a very limited payload.
This could be used for unique content creation in games or similar.
